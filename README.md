- 👋 Hi, I’m Husayn. 
- 😄 Pronouns: "Who-say-ing"

💻 Full Stack Developer | Former Call Center Supervisor | Customer-Centric Engineer. 

I recently switched into tech from a customer service personal. Transitioning from 5+ years of customer service and leadership into the world of software development — bringing soft skills, systems thinking, and execution discipline to tech. 

I enjoy interlectual discussions revolving around business ideas, health, finance, creativity and "how it's made" subjects.

🛠️ My Stack
- Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- Frameworks: React, Next.js, Node.js, Express
- Databases: MongoDB, Firebase, PostgreSQL
- Tools & Platforms: Git, GitHub, Vercel, Netlify, AWS (basic), Docker (learning)
- Design: Figma, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion

🚀 What I'm Working On
- Building scalable and accessible frontend interfaces with React + Next.js  
- Creating full-stack portfolio projects (with form handling, storage, and resume download)  
- Experimenting with IndexedDB, localStorage, and client-side persistence  
- Learning system design and backend architecture  

📈 Past Experience
Before I got into tech, I led high-performance customer support teams in the aviation industry.  
That background taught me how to think operationally, lead with empathy, and execute under pressure.
